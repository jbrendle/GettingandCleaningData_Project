GettingandCleaningData_Project
==============================

This repository holds the files to meet the requirements of the Course Project for the Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data, part of the Data Science Specialization  sponsored by Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.

The Course Project assignment was as follows:
 
 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The file run_analysis.R assumes that the raw data has been downloaded from 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
and unzipped into the working directory.

The tidy data set required by step 5 is called tidydata2.txt and is saved in this respository as well as uploaded to Coursera.

A CodeBook.md is also included with more information about tidydata2.txt.
